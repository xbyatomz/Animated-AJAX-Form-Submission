# Animated-AJAX-Form-Submission
This is an example of an AJAX animated form submission - The animation isn't the greatest

This is an example of one way of doing an animated form with an AJAX request to submit the data.
There is also an example PHP file included to show how data could be processed through it.

This probably isn't the best way of doing this task, but I am fairly new to JS and would love to hear some feedback,
to improve the quality of the code so I know for future reference.
